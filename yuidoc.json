  "description": "A simple library to spy on functions and create stubs for unit testing. Yes, there are many libraries that do this out there, but they're all tied to a specific assertion framework. Spies is not tied to any assertion frameworks. You can use any assertion frameworks you want, though it comes with a plugin for Chai expect (and possibly more in the future).",
